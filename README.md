## Getting started

The typography module allows you to add vertical rhythm to your site. It caters for responsive font sizes, and covers nearly all font styles for body copy, headers and components (e.g. Tables and lists).


## Settings (Important)
  - Font scale ratio: Defines the ratio for all fonts. The larger the number, the larger all of the settings in the file.
  - Baseline line height: Sets the line height for all typographical elements on the page. 
  - Browser default font size: The baseline font size for all browsers.

## Files
  - Typography.less: Edit this file
  - Typography.css: Compiled version of this module
